# EDA

A data consists of `variables` and `cases`. A case is the same as record in general programming.

3 types of univariate statistics that we are interested in for each `variable`:

1. General info: data type, count of total values, number of unique values

2. Range and middle: min, max, mean, median, mode, quartiles

3. Normality and spread: standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis

Problem: Investigate the relationship between a country's level of democracy and its level of economic development, and identify any potential factors that may influence this relationship.

Data: A dataset containing information on various indicators of democracy and economic development for a selection of countries, including measures of political freedom, electoral integrity, government effectiveness, rule of law, corruption, GDP per capita, and poverty rate. The dataset includes data on over 100 countries.

Constraints/Limitations: The data may not be complete or up-to-date for all countries, and the indicators used may not be comprehensive or fully representative of democracy or economic development. Additionally, other factors (such as cultural, historical, or geographical factors) may also influence the relationship between democracy and economic development and should be considered in the analysis.

Key Variables: Indicators of democracy (political freedom, electoral integrity, government effectiveness, rule of law, corruption), indicators of economic development (GDP per capita, poverty rate), other potentially influencing factors (such as cultural, historical, or geographical factors)

In this example, the problem is specific and focused (investigating the relationship between democracy and economic development and identifying potential influencing factors), and there are multiple variables involved (over 100 countries with data on various indicators of democracy and economic development). The data and constraints/limitations are also clearly defined, which will help guide the rest of the analysis.
