# EDA

A data consists of `variables` and `cases`. A case is the same as record in general programming.

3 types of univariate statistics that we are interested in for each `variable`:

1. General info: data type, count of total values, number of unique values

2. Range and middle: min, max, mean, median, mode, quartiles

3. Normality and spread: standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
