Hi! Welcome to my notebook where I note down everything I study in my computer science major.

In this section, I will note more on Competitive Programming, perhaps some tips, or maybe even cool code tricks.

What is Competitive Programming? - Leetcode, but do it faster. Much faster. For good coders, like @jameslyonsswe, it takes ~45 minutes to solve a leetcode "hard" question.
But for a competitive programmer, like @tmwilliamlin168, it's a matter of minutes... or seconds.

One of my goals this year is to participate in ACM ICPC, an olympiad for college students. [addmore]
