# Must Read

Before going into the actual notes, there are a couple of things you should know:

- This is not a blog. If you want to read my thoughts, click [here](./none.md). If there is nothing, bear with me, I haven't finished the blog yet.
- The notes are made in documentation style so it is easier to read for my fellow compsci students.
- If you need some notes, feel free to save them as pdf or print them.
- The notes are organized into several topics:
    - Competitive programming
    - Data structures & Algorithms
    - C++
    - Python
    - etc. Basically, I am tutored by [Amirshokh](hhtp://amir.uz) and most of my notes will correspond to his plan.
- If you need additional information on any of the notes you can reach me at my [telergam](https://www.t.me/irgashevsamir)
- There are no comments but if you really want to criticize my notes, commit a change to the note at the end of it, and leave your contact info so I can ~~beat you~~ talk to you.
