# 2.2 Integer Data Types

## 2.2.1 Unsigned Integers

Unsigned Integers consist of 0 and positive numbers. They do not have sign, only magnitude. With *k* number of bits we can represent 2<sup>*k*</sup>  integers from 0 to 2<sup>*k*</sup>-1

## 2.2.2 Signed Integers

There are three ways to represent signed integers

- Signed magnitude

    For each code, or bit pattern, the first bit is for sign, 0 for positive, 1 for negative. The remaining bits express value.
    Not the best way to represent signed integers since we have two codes for 0, that is `00000` and `10000`.

- 1's Complement

    Complement is a formal term for *flip*. To get 1's complement of the binary string, we have to flip all of the bits, or *NOT* each bit in the string. In more formal way, directed by Dr Naseer, to get 1's complement of a bit string we have to subtract the bit pattern from `11111`.

    The same thing happens in decimal world. We have 9's complement which we can obtain by subtracting a number from `99999`. The question is, why? Imagine doing `66469 - 34568`, without idea what subtracting is. All you need to do is add 9's complement of `34568` to `66469` and give no ~~shit~~ about carry (actually, we need to add 1 to 9's complement so we kind give ~~shit~~ about it). So

    ```
    66 469_
    34 568
    31 901

    9's complement(34568) == 65 431
    
    66 469+
    65 431
   131 900-|
           |
    31 901<- carry goes here 
    ```
