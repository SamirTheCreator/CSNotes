# 2.2 Integer Data Types

## 2.2.1 Unsigned Integers

Unsigned Integers consist of 0 and positive numbers. They do not have sign, only magnitude. With *k* number of bits we can represent 2<sup>*k*</sup>  integers from 0 to 2<sup>*k*</sup>-1

## 2.2.2 Signed Integers

There are three ways to represent signed integers

- Signed magnitude

    For each code, or bit pattern, the first bit is for sign, 0 for positive, 1 for negative. The remaining bits express value.
    Not the best way to represent signed integers since we have two codes for 0, that is `00000` and `10000`.

- 1's Complement

    Complement is a formal term for `flip`. To get 1's complement of the binary string, we have to flip all of the bits, or `NOT` each bit in the string. In more formal way, directed by Dr Naseer, to get 1's complement of a bit string we have to subtract the bit pattern from `11111`.

- 2's Complement
