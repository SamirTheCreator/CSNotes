# 2.1 Bits and Data Types

## 2.1.1 The bit as the Unit of Information

Inside computers, there are millions of veriy tiny and fast devices which control the movement of electrons. 

It is way easier to control the presence/absence of the voltage than to calculate its magnitude.

The presence of the voltage is represented by '1' and absence by '0'. We refer to each as a "bit", short for <i>binary digit</i>.
