# 2.1 Bits and Data Types

## 2.1.1 The bit as the Unit of Information

Inside computers, there are millions of veriy tiny and fast devices which control the movement of electrons. 

It is way easier to control the presence/absence of the voltage than to calculate its magnitude.

The presence of the voltage is represented by '1' and absence by '0'. We refer to each as a "bit", short for <i>binary digit</i>.

## 2.1.2 Data Types

*Data type* is a representation of digitized information that we can operate on. Each instruction set architecture (ISA) has its own set of *data types* and set of *instructions* that can operate on those data types.
